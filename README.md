# Taskosaurus Backend API

Taskosaurus is a website where the user can sign up and log in with their own profile. From here they are able to create two key items: <em>Tasks</em> and <em>Events</em>. Tasks are things that the user needs to do by a certain date in a work context and Events are things that happen on a certain date and are usually either leisurely or act as milestones in someone's life like a birthday party).

Users can then view their Tasks or Events in the respective list views and can filter based on the Current/ Archived split for the Tasks and whether it is upcoming or in the past for the Events. The Tasks list view will also highlight if the task is overdue and not complete by changing the background color of it in the list view to alert the user.

Users can also view details about a specific Task or Event by clicking on a link from the list view and will then be taken to a detail view. From here they will be able to view details of that specific Task or Event and will be able to edit it or delete the item from their Profile entirely.

The user is also able to edit their profile and change their profile picture which is displayed on the navigation bar.

Taskosaurus has a separate backend API and frontend and this README deals with the backend API section of the site.

## User Stories and Kanban Board
The Taskosaurus project was created using a GitHub Projects Kanban Board to simulate an agile workflow. The Kanban board for the project which includes both backend and frontend tasks can be found here:
